# Image_Similarity_VGG16
The VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN), which is considered to be state of the art for image recognition tasks. We are going to be using this model as a feature extractor only, meaning that we will remove the final (prediction) layer so that we can obtain a feature vector.
